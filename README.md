# XGBOOST-with-combination-of-factor.
XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting algorithm.Xgboost is short for eXtreme Gradient Boosting package.  The purpose of this Vignette is to show you how to use Xgboost to build a model and make predictions.  It is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting framework by J. Friedman et al. (2000) and J. H. Friedman (2001). Two solvers are included:  linear model ; tree learning algorithm. It supports various objective functions, including regression, classification and ranking. The package is made to be extendable, so that users are also allowed to define their own objective functions easily.
